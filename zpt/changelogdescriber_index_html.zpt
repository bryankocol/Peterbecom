<h3>Email Reminders</h3>

<p>If you like this site but don't visit it often you can instead
set up a <strong>Email Reminder</strong> to send you and email with a
summary of all the new content that has been added.</p>

<p>Don't worry, your email address <strong>will not be exploited</strong>
in any bad way and spammers will never be able to read off your email address.</p>

<p>Your Email Reminder <strong>must be confirmed</strong> so read the first
email you get after you have created an 
<strong>Email Reminder</strong>. <br />
Email Reminders can also be changed or cancelled if you want to do so.</p>
